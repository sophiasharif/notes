I had a lot of time in the summer after my senior year and during my first quarter at UCLA, so I decided to pick up web development. I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. My first project was [Minesweeper](https://sophiasharif.github.io/minesweeper-vue/) in Vue.js, which has some of the [jankiest code](https://github.com/sophiasharif/minesweeper-vue) I've ever written.

In my senior year, I had finished all the physics classes my high school offered and wanted to help others succeed in the subject, especially because of my rough start.

It is my proudest accomplishment in high school.

After a rough start, I did lots of extra practice problems to improve my problem-solving skills. The work paid off!

event: Back Fracture
date: December 2020

Throughout the fall of my sophomore year, I noticed a growing back pain when playing volleyball or doing heavy lifting. It turned out to be a spinal stress fracture from over use. I had to take a break from volleyball for several months, but after returning, I realized I was really burnt out and wanted to focus on academics. After a great run and a lot of fun, I decided to quit beach volleyball and focus on school.

event: First test fail ðŸ˜® ðŸ˜­
date: September 2019
description:
[
I challenged myself by taking a difficult physics class generally reserved for juniors and seniors. I was so excited to take the class, but I was a bit appalled when I got 58% percent on my first test. I had left the entire second half of the test blank because of the time crunch. But this was just the beginning of my physics journey... over the next months, I put in a lot of extra hours to improve my problem-solving speed.

Some refer to this as Earth's most monumental event, but I'll let you be the judge of that. I'm proud of my heritage -- my mom is Russian and my dad is Iranian, so I was born in the US but grew up in a multicultural household.
