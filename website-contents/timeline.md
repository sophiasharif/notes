I led the opening and closing ceremonies for LA Hacks 2024, a hackathon with over 1000 participants. This was by far the most people I've ever spoken to!

I organized a petition to encourage UCLA to hire Dr. Wong, one of my favorite professors, as a lecturer. Over [700 people](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8X0s9-g_muYc83c0UciqMfB-MTaUXuGo5gY83WroKo/edit?usp=sharing) signed [our petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IU_bV1gCwO47bVi9sd7LW2ZU-sijuikmyFL_8VmyMUQ/edit) and our [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1adojws/comment/kk2l7qz/) became one of the top r/ucla posts of all time! The Daily Bruin even wrote [an article](https://dailybruin.com/2024/03/01/we-really-really-love-him-students-petition-to-keep-math-professor-at-ucla) about it.
